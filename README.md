# CMSC320_Final_Project
We wanted to investigate the issue of climate change as it is very prevalent in the world today. It is an issue we feel is ignored and should be addressed more given that it is getting worse every day and affects literally everyone.

Our group decided to use these datasets because of their cleanly represented and sanitized data, the corroborating figures and complementing data, and because they contain data from the same countries.

The first dataset titled “Global Forest Data (2001-2022): Tree Cover, Biomass, and Carbon Flux Analysis” consists of several tables containing a breadth of information on tree cover and carbon emissions by country. This table contains four datasets, the largest of which contains around 28,000 rows. 

The second dataset, “CO2 emission gap among countries,” has one CSV table that contains information on carbon emissions and other data related to issues surrounding climate change. The table contains around 7,000 rows.

Both datasets paint a vivid, accurate picture of not only the effects of climate change, but also its potentially inevitable effects on our environment in the absence of swift, global intervention. This makes these datasets a crucial resource for our final project, since we aim to eventually build machine learning models capable of predicting climate trajectories while also demonstrating our cumulative data science knowledge from throughout the semester. The fact that the datasets contain information from so many years makes them good choices.
